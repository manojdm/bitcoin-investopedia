    cryptocurrencies: 'A digital currency in which transactions are verified and records maintained by a decentralized system using cryptography, rather than by a centralized authority.',
    howcryptocurrencies: 'Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from brokers, then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets.',
    topcryptocurrencies: 'Few top cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Matic, Solana, Cardano, BNB, dogecoin, shibainu, tron and fantom',
    blockchain: 'Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network',
    howblockchain: 'A distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called blocks. These blocks are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.',
    publicblockchain: 'Public blockchains are permissionless in nature, allow anyone to join, and are completely decentralized.  Public blockchains allow all nodes of the blockchain to have equal rights to access the blockchain, create new blocks of data, and validate blocks of data.',
    privateblockchain: 'Private blockchains, which may also be referred to as managed blockchains, are permissioned blockchains controlled by a single organization. In a private blockchain, the central authority determines who can be a node.  The central authority also does not necessarily grant each node with equal rights to perform functions.',
    consortiumblockchain: 'Consortium blockchains are permissioned blockchains governed by a group of organizations, rather than one entity, as in the case of the private blockchain.  Consortium blockchains, therefore, enjoy more decentralization than private blockchains, resulting in higher levels of security.',
    hybridblockchain: 'Hybrid blockchains are blockchains that are controlled by a single organization, but with a level of oversight performed by the public blockchain, which is required to perform certain transaction validations.',
    nft: 'NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated.',
    hownft:'NFTs are created through a process called minting in which the information of the NFT is published on a blockchain. At a high-level, the minting process entails a new block being created, the information of the NFT being validated by a validator, and the information being recorded. This minting process often entails incorporating smart contracts that assign ownership and manage the transferability of the NFT.',
    trading: 'Trading is the buying and selling of securities, such as stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities, as opposed to investing, which suggests a buy-and-hold strategy. Trading success depends on a trader\'s ability to be profitable over time',
    daytrading: 'This trading strategy involves taking positions and exiting on the same day. The aim of a trader while adopting such a trade is to book profits amid intraday price movements in a cryptocurrency of his choice. For a successful trade, investors often rely on technical indicators to figure out entry and exit points for particular crypto.',
    rangetrading: 'Market players also rely on experienced analysts, who give out support and resistance levels each day. ‘Resistance’ refers to the point up to which the price may rise and therefore a resistance level is a price above the current price. In contrast, ‘Support’ is a level below which a crypto price is not supposed to fall, hence a support level is always below the current price.',
    highfrequencytrading: 'HFT is a kind of algorithmic trading strategy used by quant traders. This involves developing algorithms and trading bots that help quickly enter and exit a crypto asset. Developing such bots needs an understanding of complex market concepts and a strong knowledge of mathematics and computer science. Therefore, it is more suited for advanced traders than beginners.',
    dollarcostaveraging: 'When it comes to finding the perfect entry and exit point in a crypto market, it is best to assume that timing the market is next to impossible. So, a rather sound way to go about investing in cryptos is ‘Dollar Cost Averaging’(DCA). DCA refers to investing a fixed amount at a regular interval. This strategy helps investors do away with the cumbersome job of timing the markets and building wealth in the long term.',
    bitcoin: 'Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency, a virtual currency designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity, thus removing the need for third-party involvement in financial transactions. It is rewarded to blockchain miners for the work done to verify transactions and can be purchased on several exchanges.',
    ethereum: 'Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that establishes a peer-to-peer network that securely executes and verifies application code, called smart contracts. Smart contracts allow participants to transact with each other without a trusted central authority.',
    tether: 'Tether tokens are assets that move across the blockchain just as easily as other digital currencies but that are pegged to real-world currencies on a 1-to-1 basis. Tether tokens are referred to as stablecoins because they offer price stability as they are pegged to a fiat currency.',
    polygon: 'Polygon is a “layer two” or “sidechain” scaling solution that runs alongside the Ethereum blockchain — allowing for speedy transactions and low fees. MATIC is the network’s native cryptocurrency, which is used for fees, staking, and more. You can buy or sell MATIC via exchanges like Coinbase.',
    solana: 'Solana is a crypto computing platform that aims to achieve high transaction speeds without sacrificing decentralization. It employs a bundle of novel approaches, including the “proof of history” mechanism.',
    dogecoin: 'Dogecoin (DOGE) was created as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in 2013. The name and Shiba Inu logo are based on a meme. Unlike Bitcoin, which was designed to be scarce, Dogecoin is intentionally abundant — with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum supply.',
    shibainu: 'Shiba Inu (or SHIB) is a token designed  to be an Ethereum-compatible alternative to Dogecoin (DOGE). Like DOGE, SHIB is intentionally abundant — with an initial circulating supply of one quadrillion coins. The Shiba Inu ecosystem also supports projects such as an NFT art incubator and a decentralized exchange called Shibaswap.',
    cardano: 'Cardano is one of the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap. It’s designed to be a flexible, sustainable, and scalable blockchain platform for running smart contracts — which will allow the development of a wide range of decentralized finance apps, new crypto tokens, games, and more.',
    tron: 'Tron is a blockchain-based digital platform that primarily hosts entertainment applications. It has its own in-house cryptocurrency, called Tronix or TRX. TRX ranks 31st among cryptocurrencies in market capitalization.',
    bnb: 'Binance Coin is the cryptocurrency issued by the Binance exchange and trades with the BNB symbol. BNB was initially based on the Ethereum network but is now the native currency of Binance\'s own blockchain, the Binance chain.',
    fantom: 'Fantom\'s native utility token — FTM — powers the entire Fantom blockchain ecosystem. FTM tokens are used for staking, governance, payments, and fees on the network. There is a total supply of 3.175 billion FTM coins, with 2.5 billion in circulation as of March 2021.'
